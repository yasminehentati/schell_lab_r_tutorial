A tutorial to learn spatial ecology in R for the Schell lab, February 2025


To prepare:
Create a new folder where your R project will be
Create a new folder within that called “data” 
Clone this Github repository OR download the contents using the green Code button > “Download zip” and unzip to your main folder (you don’t need Github for this step – this will just allow you to have an identical file setup!) 
Download the Schell Lab UWIN Master List 
Delete the first row of the first tab (East Bay cameras) so you only have a title row and a row for each site 
Save the first tab as a .csv titled “eastbay_sites” in “data” 
Download ___ and put it in “data” 
Download ___ and put it in “data” 
Open the .Rmd file (in the GIthub download) and follow the directions to install the packages you’ll need in the first chunk of code 
That’s it!
