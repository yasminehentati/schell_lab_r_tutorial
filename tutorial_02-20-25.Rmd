### Schell Lab R Spatial Tutorial
## by Yasmine Hentati
## 2/28/25

Packages: 

```{r}
install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(tidycensus, sf, terra, mapview, tidyr, dplyr, readr, here)

```

First we'll read in our data and turn it into a spatial format R can work with (sf). Here we'll work with the UWIN/Schell Lab East Bay camera trap points (saved as a .csv directly from the first tab of the Master UWIN Bay Area spreadsheet). I like to use UTMs (easting/northing) instead of lat/long, so we'll also convert the points so we can project it properly. 

```{r}

all_sites <- read_csv(here(""))

all_sites <- st_as_sf(all_sites, coords=c("long", "lat"), crs="EPSG:4326")
```
